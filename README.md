# Paintings-Generation

One of the most significant skills mastered by humans is creating fine arts especially with paintings.Humans are capable of generating arts from description and This skill is only limited to humans.However, it would be of great interest to build computer algorithms that are able to learn imagesfrom  their  description.   The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  develop  neural  network  models  whichwould learn to generate images in form of art given some descriptions in form of text.

In this project, a new architecture for generating paintings from text is developedand investigated.   The work is based on multi-phase architectures.   There havebeen undertakings in generating images from captions.  This project extends thatto generating paintings through style transfer integration, from captions. Availabledata contain photographs of flowers and their captions and not paintings. To gen-erate a dataset of what paintings of flowers would look like, a watercolor paintingdataset of the same captioned data is created using style transfer.  A separate ar-chitecture, performing text-to-image followed by image-to-text is then trained onthis painting dataset to create paintings from captions, and captions back from thegenerated paintings to learn from semantic consistency
